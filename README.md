# MOD_VISIOPE
The aim of this project is to perform a multiple object detection and classification. In order to tackle this problem we studied the problem of decting chess pieces.
We created a new datasatet and we did fine tuning. 
Dataset and weights are stored in the following google drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12tvcaGpfd5d-p8gWrCDh68Gjj0G-TArz?usp=sharing.
All the necessary parts are on the colab notebook. 
Here are a couple of output:
