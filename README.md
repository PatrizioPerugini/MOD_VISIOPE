# MOD_VISIOPE
The aim of this project is to perform a multiple object detection and classification. In order to tackle this problem, we studied the problem of decting chess pieces.
We created a new datasatet and we fine tuned. 
Dataset and weights are stored in the [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12tvcaGpfd5d-p8gWrCDh68Gjj0G-TArz?usp=sharing)
and all the necessary parts are on the [colab notebook](/proj_vision.ipynb). 
Here are a couple of output:
